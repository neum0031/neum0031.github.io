Dear [Client Contact Name],

Thank you for giving Sierra Legal Pty Ltd (Sierra Legal) the opportunity to provide a proposal for the provision of [legal advisory services/document automation services] to [Client Entity Name(s)] in relation to [brief description of the matter].

(Optional) Background

[Insert Background details]

[if not related to document automation services]
Scope of Work

Set out below are the legal services to be provided by Sierra Legal to [Client Entity Name(s)] in respect of [summarise matter]:
 [insert Services as dot points or in a table]

Our legal costs

[Legal costs options:]
Fee cap option:
I estimate that our legal fees for completing the work specified in the “Scope of Work” section above will be in the range of $[fee estimate lower] to $[fee estimate upper] plus GST and disbursements.

However, I would be happy to cap our fees for this work to a maximum of [fee_cap_amount] (plus GST and any disbursements at cost).

Monthly plan option:
We propose a monthly retainer arrangement under which we will provide legal services to [Client Entity Name(s)] for a fixed monthly fee of $[monthly_plan_fee] plus GST. This would include up to [included_hours] hours of legal services per month.

We understand that usage may vary slightly from month to month, and we are happy to accommodate reasonable fluctuations in hours as long as they remain within a commercially appropriate range.

Any time worked beyond the included hours will be [insert overage_terms].

This arrangement will have an initial term of [plan_term], after which it can be reviewed and renewed as needed.

Estimate option:
I estimate that our legal fees for completing the work specified in the “Scope of Work” section above will be in the range of approximately $[fee estimate lower] to $[fee_estimate_upper] (plus GST and any disbursements at cost).

The above range is an estimate and not a quote for a fixed maximum sum. It has been prepared on the basis of the scope of work and assumptions (if any) set out above, and the assumption that the number of issues that will be identified are similar to other matters of comparable size and nature, and that any negotiations and dealings with third parties proceed in a reasonable, orderly and cooperative manner.

Success fee option:
For this matter, we propose a success fee arrangement. Our legal fees will be contingent upon achieving specific outcomes as agreed upon with you.

We will charge a base fee of $[base_fee_amount] plus GST and disbursements.

In addition to the base fee, a success fee of $[success_fee_amount] plus GST will be payable upon achieving the agreed outcomes.

Fixed fee option:
I estimate that our legal fees for completing the work specified in the “Scope of Work” section above will be in the range of approximately $[fee estimate lower] to $[fee_estimate_upper] (plus GST and any disbursements at cost).

For this matter [these matters] we propose to charge [client_abbreviation] a fixed fee of $[fixed_fee_amount] plus GST.

(If disbursements)
Disbursements
I estimate that there will be disbursements of approximately $[disbursement_amount] inclusive of GST, relating to [disbursement_description].
OR
I do not expect there to be any disbursements for this matter.

(Include if there are Disbursements)
Estimate of total legal costs 
 
Accordingly, we estimate that our total legal costs, including disbursements, for this matter will be up to $[Upper fee estimate + disbursement amount] (being $[(Upper fee estimate + disbursement amount) * 0.1] including GST).

- The services do not include a review of documents generated by [Client Entity Name(s)] using the platform.
[end]
[if no exclusions]
This estimate is based on our current understanding of the present circumstances of the matter and may change depending on the nature and scope of the work.   We will notify you if it is anticipated that our total legal costs for the matter will materially exceed the above total estimate.
