Hi Iain,
 
Thank you for sending through the franchise agreement.
 
I have had the opportunity to review the document and am pleased to provide a proposal for the provision of document automation services to Endota (No 1) Pty Ltd ACN 107 095 983 (Endota) in relation to the franchise agreement package.
 
Specifications
We propose to create a bespoke web application for Endota with the following key features:
A web interface with a combination of text input fields, yes/no, and multiple-choice questions required to generate the franchise agreement.
Access to the web application via browser through the URL (www.arreis.com.au),
Documents generated in DOCX format (to allow for subsequent editing and/or negotiation) and automatically emailed to the relevant Endota user.
Ongoing support and maintenance for the document automation system, including yearly updates to the disclosure document within the system.
with all required systems hosted by us.
No limit on the number of Endota users accessing the web application.
 
As part of our franchise agreement automation service, we typically include automation of the associated documents, such as the Disclosure Document and the Guarantee and Indemnity, at no additional cost. If you decide to proceed and would like these documents included, please forward your current Disclosure Document for us to review and incorporate.
 
Fees
We propose a pricing structure that reflects our commitment to investing in our relationship with Endota. Under this structure, we take on much of the risk associated with the development work:
 
An upfront trust payment of $5000, which will be offset against future franchise agreement generation fees.
Until $10,000 (plus GST) has been recovered by Sierra Legal, $700 (plus GST) for each franchise agreement generated.
Once $10,000 (plus GST) has been recovered by Sierra Legal, $350 (plus GST) for each franchise agreement generated.
 
Please note, in situations where a franchise agreement needs to be regenerated (based on changes requested by the franchisee or incorrect inputs), no additional fee will be charged.
 
Assumptions and Exclusions
Minor changes to documents within the franchise agreement package that do not require legal advice and do not exceed 4 hours of drafting or coding time per 12-month period will be included at no additional cost.
For non-minor changes or for legal advice in relation to the franchise agreement, additional fees will apply, subject to prior agreement with Endota.
The services do not include a review of documents generated by Endota using the platform.
 
Trust Account
An upfront trust payment of $5000 is required for this service, from which initial package generation fees will be deducted.
 
Next Steps
Please review the proposal and let us know if you have any questions or would like to proceed.
Upon confirmation, we will prepare a formal engagement letter for your approval.
 
Kind regards,
