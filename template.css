Dear [Client Contact Name],

Thank you for giving Sierra Legal Pty Ltd (Sierra Legal) the opportunity to provide legal advisory services to [Client Entity Name(s)] in relation to [brief description of the matter].

(Optional) Background
[Insert Background details]

Scope of Work
Set out below are the legal services to be provided by Sierra Legal to [Client Entity Name(s)] in respect of [summarise matter]:
 [insert Services as dot points or in a table]

Our legal costs
[Legal costs options:]
Fee cap option:
I estimate that our legal fees for completing the work specified in the “Scope of Work” section above will be in the range of $[fee estimate lower] to $[fee estimate upper] plus GST and disbursements.

However, I would be happy to cap our fees for this work to a maximum of [fee_cap_amount] (plus GST and any disbursements at cost).

Monthly plan option:
We propose a monthly retainer arrangement under which we will provide legal services to [Client Entity Name(s)] for a fixed monthly fee of $[monthly_retainer_fee] plus GST. This would include up to [included_hours] hours of legal services per month.

[If include_reasonable_use = Yes]: We understand that usage may vary slightly from month to month, and we are happy to accommodate reasonable fluctuations in hours as long as they remain within a commercially appropriate range. [Insert reasonable_use_description if provided.]
Any time worked beyond the included hours will be [insert overage_policy].

[If retainer_term is specified]: This arrangement will have an initial term of [retainer_term], after which it can be reviewed and renewed as needed.

Estimate option:
I estimate that our legal fees for completing the work specified in the “Scope of Work” section above will be in the range of approximately $[fee estimate lower] to $[fee_estimate_upper] (plus GST and any disbursements at cost).

The above range is an estimate and not a quote for a fixed maximum sum. It has been prepared on the basis of the scope of work and assumptions (if any) set out above, and the assumption that the number of issues that will be identified are similar to other matters of comparable size and nature, and that any negotiations and dealings with third parties proceed in a reasonable, orderly and cooperative manner.

Success fee option:
For this matter, we propose a success fee arrangement. Our legal fees will be contingent upon achieving specific outcomes as agreed upon with you.

We will charge a base fee of $[base_fee_amount] plus GST and disbursements.

In addition to the base fee, a success fee of $[success_fee_amount] plus GST will be payable upon achieving the agreed outcomes.

Fixed fee option:
I estimate that our legal fees for completing the work specified in the “Scope of Work” section above will be in the range of approximately $[fee estimate lower] to $[fee_estimate_upper] (plus GST and any disbursements at cost).

For this matter [these matters] we propose to charge [client_abbreviation] a fixed fee of $[fixed_fee_amount] plus GST.

(If disbursements)
Additionally, I estimate that there will be disbursements of approximately $[disbursement_amount] inclusive of GST, relating to [disbursement_description].
OR
I do not expect there to be any disbursements for this matter.

Assumptions and exclusions
I assume that you do not need our assistance with the following tasks in connection with the matter:
 [List any assumptions or out-of-scope tasks]

Trust Account

We look forward to working with you.
